Coding challenge

to run the server, use: nodemon server/app.js

to run the app, use: npm start

in pages/table/index there is some commented out code (applyNewMessage), so that you can easily test some new live incoming messages inside of a topic

challenge was fun, however some ready graphql server delivered by you would make it a bit easier

let me know if there are any problems with running the server locally or with the app!

see you soon!
